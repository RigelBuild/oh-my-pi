/**
 * restart — cooperatively recycle this session to pick up host-staged changes
 * that a live `refresh` cannot reach (new extensions, project context, slash
 * commands, prompt templates, the tool roster, the model/provider registry).
 *
 * Restart recycles ONLY this session (same loaded engine code): the host
 * quiesces the running turn, flushes the transcript to disk, disposes the
 * session, then re-opens it from its file. Picking up a new engine *binary* is a
 * host-process operation, never this per-agent tool.
 *
 * Deadlock-critical shape: `execute()` returns an acknowledgement immediately,
 * then fires `requestRestart()` from an UNTRACKED continuation — never inline
 * (its `waitForIdle()` cannot resolve while the tool blocks the turn) and never
 * via `#schedulePostPromptTask` (that scheduler always tracks the task in
 * `#postPromptTasks`, and `requestRestart()`'s own `waitForIdle()` / `dispose()`
 * await that very set → self-deadlock). Absent from `#postPromptTasks`, the
 * continuation sits in neither set the restart drains; `requestRestart()`'s
 * internal `waitForIdle()` supplies the "let this turn settle" wait.
 *
 * Result reporting splits on dispose ordering. Pre-dispose refusals
 * (`busy`/`unavailable`/`no-session-file`, all returned before teardown) are
 * surfaced to the still-open transcript so the model sees them. A post-dispose
 * host-callback throw has no awaiting caller on this path — dispose already
 * closed the transcript — so it is caught and logged (recovery via the durable
 * session file), never left unhandled and never silently swallowed.
